        <h1>Lasagna Recipe</h1>
        <img src="../images/lasagna" alt="Picture of Homemade Lasagna">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients-list"> 
            <li><b>Meat:</b> This lasagna starts with a pound of meat (1/2 pound of ground pork, 1/2 ground beef.)</li>
            <li><b>Onions:</b> A diced onion cooked until translucent with the meat.</li>
            <li><b>Canned Tomatoes:</b> You will need a can of tomato sauce as well as canned tomatoes.</li>
            <li><b>Fresh Herbs:</b> For fresh flavour, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
            <li><b>Sugar:</b> A dash of sugar to balance out the acidity of the tomatoes.</li>
            <li><b>Spices and Seasoning:</b> This lasgna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li><b>Noodles:</b> Can't have lasgna without lasgna noodles! This recipes uses uncooked noodles but you can use the oven ready type to save time.</li>
            <li><b>Cheese:</b> The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella. </li>
            <li><b>Eggs:</b> Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (holding the layer together)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol class="directions">
            <li><b>Cook the Meat:</b>Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.</li>
            <li><b>Cook the noodles:</b>Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.</li>
            <li><b>Make the cheese layer:</b>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
            <li><b>Assemble the lasgna:</b>Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.</li>
            <li><b>Bake the lasgna:</b>Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>How long to cook the pasta</h2>
        <p>In an oven preheated to 375 degrees F, this homemade lasagna should be perfectly baked in about 50 minutes (30-40 minutes covered, 5-10 minutes uncovered).</p>
